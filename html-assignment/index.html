        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I am a freelance photographer based in
          <abbr title="Canada">CA</abbr> with over 4<sup>+</sup> years of
          professional experience capturing moments that tell real and
          meaningful stories. My journey into photography has been driven by
          passion, discipline, and a strong desire to visually communicate
          emotion, identity, and authenticity. I specialize in portraits,
          lifestyle photography, and creative visual projects, working closely
          with clients to bring their ideas to life while maintaining a strong
          personal artistic vision.
        </p>

        <p>
          My creative vision and imagination led me to build my photography
          brand studio called <em>Mr.Myeyesonly</em>, a name that represents how
          I see the world through my own unique perspective. I believe
          photography is not just about images, but about personal eyesight,
          emotion, and intention. That philosophy inspired my slogan,
          <em>“The eyesight studio”</em>, which reflects my commitment to
          capturing moments exactly as I envision them. Through this brand, I
          transform imagination into visual stories that feel intimate, bold,
          and authentic.
